## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working on this, I learnt how to create better looking buttons using the following border properties on CSS

        border-top-left-radius: 50px;
        border-top-right-radius: 50px;
        border-bottom-left-radius: 50px;
        border-bottom-right-radius: 50px;

I also learnt how to use the filter property on CSS to change the color of a SVG file.

### Continued development

Futher development would be on Javascript...
